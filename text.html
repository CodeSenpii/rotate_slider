<p class='up1'>I love to dance. From ever since I</p>
<p>could <span data-content="re mem ber">remember</span> I just loved dancing.</p>
<p>I love moving my feet to a nice beat.</p>
<p id="p1">I love <span data-content="th row ing">throwing</span> my hands in the air</p>


<p class='up2'>and <span data-content="t were ling">twirling</span> around and around. Step,</p>
<p>jump and <span>twirl</span>. Hands high and <span data-content="fing er s">fingers</span></p>
<p>pointed all the way up to the sky. Don’t</p>
<p id="p2"><span data-content="for get">forget</span> to point those toes with each step!</p>

<p class='up3'>I love <span data-content="dan c-ing">dancing</span> so much that I have an</p>
<p><span data-content="In st ruc tor">instructor</span>. Her name is Ms. Beverly and</p>
<p>she teaches me the <span data-content="pro-p er">proper</span> way to dance.</p>
<p id="p3">Ms. Beverly is a <span data-content="pro fes sh-on al">professional</span> instructor.</p>

<p class='up4'>That just means she can dance really really well.</p>
<p>My <span span data-content="In st ruck tor">instructor</span> makes dancing look so easy. It takes a long </p>
<p>time to <span data-content="be come">become</span> a good dancer like my teacher. Maybe one day</p>
<p id="p4">I can be as good a dancer like Ms. Beverly.</p>


<p class='up5'>All I have to do is <span data-content="prac tice">practice</span> and practice.</p>
<p>Step, jump and twirl that is how it goes</p>
<p>over and over till you <span data-content="per fect">perfect</span> the form.</p>
<p id="p5">Dancing has many forms and <span data-content="s ty l-s">styles</span></p>

<p class='up6'>Some styles of dancing are hip hop, ballet and</p>
<p><span data-content="ball room">ballroom</span> style of dancing. Some styles of</p>
<p>dancing require more than one person. For <span data-content="ex am ple">example</span>, Ballroom</p>
<p id="p6">dancing <span data-content="re qui r es">requires</span> 2 persons.</p>


<p class='up7'>A dance group can be very large and</p>
<p>have as many as 10 persons or even more.</p>
<p>I have even seen dance groups as big as 100 people!</p>
<p id="p7">Wow, that is a huge group of people dancing.</p>

<p class='up8'>Big <span data-content="gr oop s">groups</span> can be fun, but I love dancing</p>
<p>by myself, in dance class and at home.</p>
<p>I dance in my room. I dance in the <span data-content="kit ch en">kitchen</span>.</p>
<p id="p8">I even dance when I am <span data-content="out side">outside</span>. <span data-content="Some time s">Sometimes</span></p>

<p class='up9'>I can dance for hours. Dancing is so much</p>
<p>fun and it makes me happy. Dancing is also</p>
<p>good <span data-content="ex er ci se">exercise</span>, that’s what my dad always</p>
<p id="p9">says. But I don’t dance for the exercise,</p>


<p class='up10'>I dance <span data-content="sim p ly">simply</span> because I love to do it.</p>
<p>I will never stop dancing to the end of</p>
<p>my days. Even when I’m old and <span data-content="g ray">grey</span></p>
<p id="p10">I will always be dancing. Step, jump</p>

<p class='up11'>twirl and twist then <span data-content="re peat">repeat</span>, that’s how it</p>
<p>is done. I will dance till the end of time.</p>
<p>Step, jump, twirl and twist <span data-content="ag ain">again</span> and again.</p>
<p id="p11">I love to dance. Come and danc with me.</p>
